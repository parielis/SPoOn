# SPoOn
Sustainable Polis Ontology (SPoOn) is an ontology of urban sustainability, aligned with Greek regulations and terms. 
The class hierarchy and skos concepts stuctures have been created.

It includes Street and Park individuals with data properties related to graph theory (eg.centralities) and OSM values. Some properties are populated through SPARQL queries (eg. street scores) and SWRL rules that have been applied for categorization and classification.

It also includes regulation-relate classes and area individuals (like potential park areas).

Finally, in this version TWA ontologies, GeoSPARQL and CityGML are imported so there can be some mappings with the SPoOn ontology to be interoperable with geospatial standards and different contexts.
